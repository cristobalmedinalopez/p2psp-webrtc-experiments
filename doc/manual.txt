Welcome to the Peer-to-Peer Streaming Protocol (P2PSP) Project!

The P2PSP is a simple (almost trivial) protocol for the streaming of
real-time video/audio sequences. For more information about the
definition and operation of the P2PSP, please, read the P2PSP.txt
file.

To create a streaming service using the P2PSP, you need for elements:

1. An HTTP streaming server (Icecast2, for example).

2. The source, which usually run in the same machine than Icecast2
   (notice that the bandwidth between Icecast2 and the source should
   be always guaranteed).

3. One o more peers, spread in a set of remote hosts, and if you want,
   in the same source's host. See P2PSP.txt to know why you should to
   do this.

4. An HTTP streaming client/player (VLC, for example). The P2PSP
   doesn't make assumptions about the format or content of the stream,
   except that at the beginning there is a header of a known
   size. Therefore, is your responsability to select a player
   compatible with the stream.
