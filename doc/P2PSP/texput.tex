Welcome to the Peer-to-Peer Streaming Protocol (P2PSP) Project!

The P2PSP is a simple (almost trivial) protocol for the streaming of
real-time video/audio sequences. This file describes the P2PSP rules,
and some tricks to overcome the limitations imposed by some NATs. For
learnig about the use of the P2PSP, please, read the manual.txt
file.
